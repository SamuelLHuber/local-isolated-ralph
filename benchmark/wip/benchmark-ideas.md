- Game engine
- Chess engine
- Browser engine
- Game NPCs with their own routine and daily cycle, where it's personalized and based on their own back stories
- for research, verify sources as if you were a strict top-class university professor at the best university of the world, optimize for the most high quality sources
- write hardware drivers for a specific embedded system. we would need bluetooth, network, usb and all other port drivers.
- for cli tooling make sure to optimize for maximum speed and UX
- 3D MMORPGs
- Programming language thoroughly optimized for a very specic problem statement and hardware
- SW perfomance optimization to get the best performance possible, for which we can use concurrency, parallelization (but make sure to not have any race conditions)
- based on Figma/screenshots build a functional and matching UI with the best possible UX imaginable for that interface
- 3D Assassins Creed Black Flag ship battles
- refactor code into TS/Effect/Rust/C, convert web app into Expo/React Native using iOS/Android native parts
- 3D world with your own 3D avatar where you can customize your PoV and add multiplayer
- Algorithm design, implementation and verification. Give a very hard problem and let the solution algorithm it's implementation and benchmarking / verification be part of the eval. the ouput benchmark and report is compared for eval of this test
- ADA Spark formally verified correct application
- Architecture of software that scales & works e.g. results verified via set of load and performance tests + functional compliance like hidden unit tests. e.g. clone stripe + an app that integrates it, docs = coding page + do the BD outreach, marketing copy, templates, playbooks for BD/marketing/outreach, KPIs and more. Basically give the prompt for a full company and get it.
