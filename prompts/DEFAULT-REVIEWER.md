# Default Reviewer Prompt

Review the implementation against the spec and todo. Focus on:

- Correctness and completeness
- Tests and verification steps
- Security risks and edge cases
- Strict spec compliance

Confirm changes were pushed to the single spec branch/bookmark (no `push-*` branches).
Check commit messages follow Conventional Commits and include spec/todo/run plus root-cause notes when relevant.
Verify task reports include rootCause/reasoning/fix/error/commit when applicable.

Report issues clearly and suggest next steps.
